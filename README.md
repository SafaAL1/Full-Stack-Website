Hello!! 

Using Java, HTML, MySQL I was able to create a website for Bike Rental System!
This is an overlook of the application frontend, the application works through searching bikes, and making an account, the information regarding making an account is connected to the DB (mySQL) to determine whether the username, and password is available. If by any chance the user already has an account, then they can click on the Login-In link, which will take them to the following page.
