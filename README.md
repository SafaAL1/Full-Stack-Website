Hello!! 

Using Java, HTML, MySQL I was able to create a website for Bike Rental System!
This is an overlook of the application frontend, the application works through searching bikes, and making an account, the information regarding making an account is connected to the DB (mySQL) to determine whether the username, and password is available. If by any chance the user already has an account, then they can click on the Login-In link, which will take them to the following page.

This page focuses on authenticating the user and ensuring that they do infact exist through using JWT token and checking the Database.

What is a REST API? It's a method of communication between software systems over the internet using the HTTP protocol. I have implemented a package called "endpoint," which is responsible for the REST API. The "BIKE_CRUD" package is responsible for connecting to the microservice and searching for bikes within the system. The "SearchBusiness" component ensures that the requested data is converted to XML. The following display illustrates what "SearchBike" has found:
